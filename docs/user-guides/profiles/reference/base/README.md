# Profile: base

## Chain:

### base (1.0.0)
Minimal task CRUD foundation. Provides essential tools, a pending-tasks resource, and shared date/text rules. Extend via `extends: base` for richer workflows.


**Instructions sources:** (see Instructions section)

## Tools
| Tool | Declared in (chain) | Final owner |
|---|---|---|
| add_task | base | base |
| get_task | base | base |
| query_tasks | base | base |
| update_task | base | base |
| delete_task | base | base |
| done_task | base | base |

## Prompts
- None

## UDAs
- None

## Contexts

## Resources:
| URI | backend.function | params | name | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| taskmajor://tasks/pending | query_tasks | {"filter": "status:pending", "sort": ["urgency"]} | Pending Tasks |  |

## Instructions

# Base Profile Objective

Provide the shared TaskMajor foundation for every profile. Capture tasks quickly, keep triage consistent, and make the next action obvious.


---

# Workflow

1. Capture with `add_task`; keep the description direct and action-oriented.
2. Triage with `update_task`; change at least one field before saving.
3. Execute with `done_task` when work is finished.


---

# TaskWarrior Date Expressions

## Workflow
- Always call `resolve_date` before using any date in `add_task` or `update_task`.
- Call `validate_date` when the expression comes from user input.
- Call `read_mcp_resource("taskmajor://now")` to know the current date, time, timezone, and shortcuts (`eod`, `eow`, `eom`).

## Precision
- `due:today+17h` → today at 17:00:00
- `due:now+2h` → 2 hours from now
- `due:today+9.5h` → today at 09:30:00
- `due:today+570min` → today at 09:30:00
- `⚠ due:today+9h30m` → BROKEN (do not use)

## Synonyms (case-insensitive)
- `today` / `now` — current datetime
- `yesterday` / `tomorrow`
- `monday` … `sunday` (or `mon` … `sun`)
- `eod` — end of day (today 23:59:59)
- `eow` — end of week (Sunday 23:59:59)
- `eom` — end of month (last day of current month 23:59:59)
- `sod` — start of day (today 00:00:00)
- `sow` — start of week (Monday 00:00:00)
- `som` — start of month (1st 00:00:00)

## Relative expressions
- `now+2h`, `now+30min`, `now+90s`
- `today+3d`, `today+2w`, `today+1mo`
- `next monday`, `last friday`

## ISO 8601 durations
- `P2W` → `P14D`
- `PT3H` → `PT3H`
- `P1M`, `P1Y`

## Rules
- Always `resolve_date` before submitting to avoid silent failures.
- Use `now` for relative precision, `today` for day-level dates.
- Never use `today+XhYm` syntax; use decimal hours or total minutes.
- Confirm the timezone with `taskmajor://now` when scheduling across timezones.

# Text Quality

- Pass strings directly as UTF-8.
- Do not escape quotes, accents, or apostrophes.
- Emojis are supported and welcome.
- Preserve the user's language and formatting as written.
- Build task text directly; do not route it through shell escaping.
